          <h2>Road to Limansk: Heart of the Zone is a tense horror shooter with survival elements, set in a mysterious and deadly environment where reality itself is unstable. You play as Lieutenant Alexey "Grach" Kuznetsov, a soldier who, along with his squad, is transported into the Zone by an unexplained aerial anomaly. Stranded in this nightmarish wasteland, you must navigate abandoned locations, uncover hidden secrets, and battle horrific creatures that were once human.
          Your only chance of survival is to reach the Limansk Research Complex, a long-forgotten facility where the Zone's true nature may finally be revealed. However, the journey is fraught with danger—mutants, deadly anomalies, and the constant threat of losing your mind in a world where time and space are no longer stable.</h2>
